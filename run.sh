# There are no package.json or similar dependency management files provided,
# so there are no dependencies to install for a browser extension.
# Browser extensions do not require a build step or dependencies installation
# like npm or yarn for JavaScript libraries, as they run in the browser context.

# To run the codebase, you would load the extension into the browser manually.
# For Google Chrome, you would do the following:

# 1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
#    Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Extensions menu button
#    and selecting Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
#    Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Chrome menu,
#    hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.

# 2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

# 3. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

# There is no command line equivalent for loading an unpacked extension in Chrome.
